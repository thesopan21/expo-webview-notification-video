### Requirements

#### 1. WebView Page

- Embed a website inside the app.  
- Add two buttons under the WebView that trigger different local notifications.

#### 2. Notifications

- Implement at least **two distinct notification messages**.  
- Notifications should trigger with a **delay of 2‚Äì5 seconds**.

#### 3. Video Player Page

- Add a new page that plays an HLS video using Expo‚Äôs video player.  
- Use this test URL:  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Choices

### 1. WebView

Used react-native-webview to embed a website inside the app.
Chosen for its simplicity and support for both iOS and Android.
Added two buttons below the WebView to trigger notifications, keeping UI consistent and user-friendly.

### 2. Notifications

Used Expo Notifications API for scheduling local notifications.
Chose delayed notifications (2‚Äì5 seconds) to demonstrate async scheduling.
Implemented two distinct messages to showcase flexibility.

### 3. Video Player

Used expo-av's Video component to play the HLS stream.
Chosen because Expo supports HLS out-of-the-box, with controls like play, pause, and fullscreen.
Tested with the sample stream:

### 4. Navigation

Used @react-navigation/native with a Stack Navigator for page-to-page navigation.
This allows smooth switching between WebView + Notifications and Video Player screens.
